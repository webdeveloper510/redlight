                    This Terms of Use Agreement (“Agreement”) constitutes a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an
                    entity (“you” or “your”) and No Excuses Agents LTD., together with its parent entities, subsidiary entities, owners, shareholders, affiliates and
                    members (collectively, “Company,” and sometimes “we,” “our,” or “us”), concerning your access to and use of the The Erotic Review
                    (theeroticreview.com) website (“TER”) and No Excuses Agents LTD (“No Excuses Agents LTD”), which operates TER, together with their parent
                    entities, subsidiary entities, owners, shareholders, affiliates and members (collectively, “Company,” and sometimes “we,” “our,” or “us”),
                    concerning your access to and use of TER. By clicking the “I AGREE” icon below you are manifesting your approval and agree to be bound by
                    the terms of this Agreement. Among other things, Company allows, or may in the future allow, you and other users of TER
                    (“Users”) to access TER to read and submit reviews, to read and enjoy materials posted by Company and its Users (including text, video conference or chat content,
                    software, information, data, databases, music, audio, video or audiovisual files, photographs, images, scans, documents, digital files, or other
                    materials), to participate in our discussion boards, to “chat” with other Users and to send private emails to other Users (collectively, the
                    “Services”). Some of the Services are provided free of charge, especially to those Users who take the time to write reviews which they submit to
                    TER. However, TER does provide a low payment option to help keep TER on line. (But in order to maintain its integrity, TER does not accept
                    advertising funds from the ladies or their agencies.) In a further effort to cover TER’s costs, Company may provide a limited number of advertising
                    slots for businesses whose interests do not conflict with TER’s. TER reserves the right to charge all Users fees for the Services upon notice.

Along with the Services, subscribers also enjoy the following additional benefits (collectively, “Subscription Services”) and more: unrestricted rights to read an entire review, and not just a teaser, and get to read explicit information about the ladies and the services they offer, explicit details of past encounters by other Users, have greatly enhanced search capabilities for the site (including the ability to find other providers using the same phone number), and unlike regular users, can chat with women around the country in TER’s Video Chat Rooms. Subscribers are also able to view Provider Rankings by city or by service provided, can quickly search all of the reviews submitted by other Users and can keep track of their favorite providers by adding them to their “Personal Favorites List.” Another benefit of subscribing to TER is that we send subscribers copies of new reviews about their favorite ladies so that the subscriber need not search for updated reviews. Subscribers also have the ability to email other Subscribers if they want to know more about someone's review or have questions about a provider. TER periodically changes the services it offers, and it reserves the right to change Subscription Services.</p>
